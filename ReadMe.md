# United States Geologic Survey's "Fresh Water INDEX Service API"
___

## Goals
1) Working to build useful python functions for pulling and exporting cleaned and processed data for additional analysis.
2) Examples of "time series analysis" with hydrology data using sites from the headwaters of the Arkansas river in Leadville, Colorado.
3) Creation of object oriented library for usgs fwis sensors and their data for use in real time visualization softwares. 

## Immediate Next Steps
1) Expand functions to include the full finctionality of the FWIS API. 
2) Make senorlib object values updatable.
3) Format raw data to timeseries.
4) Publish examples of time series forcasting

This Library is OpenSource. I only ask that if you use what you find here that you let me know through message or comments because its great to hear, and site me in your work for the brownie points. Very open to collaboration with those more experienced in building python libraries, Hydrologic Data Analysis, or Real Time Data Visualization in Python.
